            description: "From 1970 to 2019, floods were the most frequent weather, climate, and water-related disasters, accounting for 44% of all disasters globally. However, flood prediction apps are available only in some countries, leaving many regions unprepared. To address this, we developed RiverStream, an app that can be used worldwide. It allows users to receive and contribute flood data, while AI predicts floods in useful time and notifies users when risk increases. A simulation feature visualizes flood scenarios, raising awareness and preparedness. RiverStream builds a collaborative network to strengthen global disaster response, promoting action, prevention, and education.",
